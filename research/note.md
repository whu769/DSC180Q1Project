# Research Folder

This folder comprises the old jupyter notebooks and Python files that we (Megan and William) worked on throughout the duration of the quarter.
Most of the files do NOT have much comments and documentation as they were used as areas to experiment/test. 

### Folder Structure
There are two folders: WH and MH which are our respective code when we had individual assignments (We had to make a search engine purely off TF-IDF and a semantic search engine)

Beyond that, there are some jupyter notebook files which were made to test functions/various other things during the collaborative portion of the Q1 project.
